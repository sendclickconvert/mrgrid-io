# Why PDF Keeps Closing on Its Own - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

**PDF viewer closing unexpectedly?** This guide covers every reason why PDFs auto-close and provides systematic fixes for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS platforms.

## Common Causes of Auto-Closing PDFs

### Memory Leaks and Resource Exhaustion
When PDF viewers consume excessive RAM, operating systems force-close the application to prevent system crashes. Large PDFs (>50MB) with embedded images are common triggers.

### Background Process Termination
Mobile operating systems (Android/iOS) aggressively terminate background apps. If you switch away from your PDF reader, the OS may close it to free memory.

### Corrupted PDF Structure
PDFs with malformed page trees or broken cross-reference tables cause readers to crash immediately after opening.

## Quick Fixes

**Update PDF Reader**: Outdated software has known bugs causing auto-close issues.
**Increase RAM allocation**: Close unnecessary programs before opening large PDFs.
**Disable auto-sleep**: Mobile devices close apps during power-saving modes.
**Check file integrity**: Open PDF in alternative reader to rule out file corruption.
